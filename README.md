# Supporting Compose OtpView/PinView

Compose PinView/OtpView is an independent project with ongoing development and support made possible thanks to your donations.
- [Become a backer](https://www.paypal.me/mukeshsolanki)

## How to integrate into your app?
Integrating the project is simple. All you need to do is follow the below steps

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```java
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency
for Compose
```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.mukeshsolanki:otpview-compose:3.1.0'
}
```

for View system
```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.mukeshsolanki:otpview:3.1.0'
}
```

## How to use the library?
Okay seems like you integrated the library in your project but **how do you use it**? Well its really easy.
- Using Compose
Just use the `OtpView` composable where you need to display the view like.
```kotlin
var otpValue by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
OtpView(
    otpText = otpValue,
    onOtpTextChange = {
        otpValue = it
        Log.d("Actual Value", otpValue)
    },
    type = OTP_VIEW_TYPE_BORDER,
    password = true,
    containerSize = 48.dp,
    passwordChar = "â€¢",
    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Number),
    charColor = Color.White
)
```
- Using Older View System (aka XML)
Add the view in your xml file like
```xml
<com.mukeshsolanki.OtpView
    android:id="@+id/otp_view"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginTop="72dp"
    android:inputType="text"
    android:itemBackground="@drawable/bg_otp_item"
    android:textAllCaps="true"
    android:textColor="@android:color/white"
    app:OtpHideLineWhenFilled="true"
    app:OtpItemCount="6"
    app:OtpItemSpacing="6dp"
    app:OtpLineColor="@color/otp_item_state"
    app:OtpState_filled="true"
    app:OtpViewType="line"
/>
```
Next in your code assign `otp_view` to a variable like
```kotlin
val otpView = findViewById(R.id.otp_view)
```
implement OnOtpCompletionListener
```kotlin
otpView.setOtpCompletionListener {
    Log.d("Actual Value", it)
}
```
That's pretty much it and your all wrapped up.
